# GC Baggo

GC Baggo is a simple Cornhole scoring application. Cornhole is a game where teams of two players play each other by throwing a bag full of corn to a board that has a hole on it. Each round consists of four throws for each team. If a bag lands in the ground, the team gets no points. If it lands in the board, the team gets 1 point. And if the bag goes in the hole, the team gets 3 points. At the end of each round, the team with the most points wins and adds the point difference to their total score.

There's two alternatives to decide the winning team:

 - At the end of a round, if a team has a total score of more than 21 points and has a lead of 2 or more points over the other team, they are declared the winners.
 - At the end of a round, if a team has a total score of 21 points exactly, they're the winners. If the team goes over their total score is reverted back to 11.
